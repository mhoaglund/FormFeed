Mobile Support:
-This may already work okay on mobile. Need to run tests.

To look out for:
-The keyboard shit. Need a real resolution to that, it's been a problem before.
-The viewport and the size of the text. It all has to stay in proportion so it has parity and makes sense.
-Interface for scrubbing (eventual enhancement)
